Reorganize flickr pics after doing a bulk download

Now that flickr is dead to me (deleting all but 1000 photos), I finally bulk downloaded all my 10,000 images. Unfortunately they just zip them up in a bunch of files. Fortunately they give you the meta-data.

This is super quick and dirty, just wrote it for myself and put it up here to hopefully save someone a few hours

Directions

1) request a full download from Flickr
2) download all the images
3) unzip all the files.
3) update the config file to point to the right directories
3) run the code
